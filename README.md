Welcome to the ESP32 Device Monitor repository!

This project is an ESP32-based device monitoring system that connects to a FRITZ!Box router via TR-064 to retrieve and display a list of connected devices in real-time. It utilizes a TFT display with LVGL for visualization and is a useful tool for network administrators or anyone interested in monitoring devices on their local network.

Features:

WiFi Connection: Automatically connects to a predefined FRITZ!Box network.

Device Monitoring: Retrieves and displays a list of connected devices via TR-064.

Real-time Updates: Detects and logs new or removed devices every 30 seconds.

TFT Display with LVGL: Presents the device list in a clear and structured format.
